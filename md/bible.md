## Ratianity Bible

In the beginning there was only Remy then he said ‘’let there be some stuff’’. Then the world was created with flowing rivers, massive mountains and very green forests everywhere and many rats ,thousands of rats. But with these rats came problems they were eating the green grass and devouring the lands so Remy sealed them within the earth’s surface. 

Many centuries later Remy decided that the earth was empty and he created humans, millions of them and they were good but they couldn't survive on just fruit so he created other animals like cows, and chickens, and other animals to fill the earth. Then humans thrived and built cities and towns. They built shrines to worship him and they offered him sacrifices but over time they forgot about Remy and so he sent his two sons Mexican Jesus and Jeff to teach the humans the ways of Remy. 

Over time Remy’s sons became influenced by the human but so they so helped them by giving them gifts and giving they knowledge but since the sons of Remy had been with the humans them had developed greed so they released a big amount of rats to the world which anger Remy and so he kept his two sons with the rats and they were killed and so peace was achieved. 

Ratianity is a group dedicated to worshiping Remy. Once there was a boy, this boy's name was Logan in the beginning Logan Carey was not a believer in Remy but eventually he became a believer of Remy, he became so dedicated he became a priest for Remy, he lived a good life until he died at the ripe age of 69 and 4 minutes.

There was once a man named Joe. Joe was a middle aged man, he was happy with his life and he was an archaeologist. So once he went to Africa once and while he was doing job he uncovered an ancient temple. This was one of many ancient temples. These temples were made long ago to summon and pray to Remy.

Joe used this temple and summoned Remy, but Remy’s power was enough to kill Joe immediately this power was enough to send a beam into the sky splitting the sky and causing massive tsunamis. This causes the sky to grow dark and the moon go red as blood, tornadoes ripped through the land lifting buildings into the atmosphere. Some of these tornadoes went into the ocean and turned into hurricanes. The world was in a state of depression and then it ended. That day the world learned not to invoke Remy’s power. 

Joe’s body fell into the sea but his body was still flooded with the power of Remy and so the government went in search of Joe’s body to extract the power of Remy and use it. 

Six months later the government found Joe’s body and extracted the energy of Remy and after they did that Joe's body turned to dust. The government used this energy at one of the ancient temples but instead of summoning Remy to them they were summoned to Remy, Remy spoke and just his voice was enough to destroy their bodies from the inside out. 

Once the small team of men were killed Remy’s plan was complete and he finally was able to escape to the real world, he was trapped in the center of the earth for two thousand years and now that the humans had started using the temples and that was enough to break the seal that held him there. 

When Remy escaped he was furious at the humans for destroying the earth and melting the glaciers and so Remy, with a flick of his hand the humans were gone with another swift movement the earth was restored the cities and buildings were gone the glaciers re-froze and the earth was restored to its prime.

Remy then made a new race of humans and they were better then the first group creating what we know today. After the humans had lived on earth for a few hundred years they had caught up to the last group of humans then they went to the temples to try and communicate with Remy but they all failed except one. This person's name was never known but they were very important to history.

This person was the only human that was able to use the temples and not die, when this man first used the temples energy he only took a small part of it because if you use more than a small amount you will either summon Remy or burn, this person was smart they took a small amount at a time and distributed it throughout the people, when the people received this energy they because stronger smarter and faster the man took small amounts of energy until there was barely enough left in the temple to sustain it. 

These temples were in different environments; the one Joe discovered and the one the humans were using are the same temples the others had not been discovered yet. This temple was floating high above the clouds in the center of the human village. There is a myth that if the temple runs out of energy the village and the temple will fall into the ocean below.

The man realized this and desperately tried to take the energy back from the people but they locked him up in the temple and would not let him out until he gave them the last of its energy and so he took the last of its energy and put in himself, the temple began to shake and crack until it fell destroying the human village attached to it and so the man braced himself and then passed out. 

When the man woke up he was on an island in the middle of the sea. And he saw half of the temple poking out of the water and what was left of the other half in pieces this man became a nomad and went village to village spreading Ratianity to the people after twenty years of doing this the man finally stopped spreading the message of Remy so that he could build a kingdom for everyone who believed in Remy, and even if you did not you could live here, this kingdom truly united the world. 

About fifteen years later the man had died of an unknown illness and for a while the kingdom functioned without a king until a giant earthquake damaged the land a lot and about two thirds of the land was destroyed and the kingdom fell apart. After these events happened the message of Remy started to die but people still believed in Remy and remembered the man's message to all of them and so they passed it down generation to generation. People visited the temples and prayed, they built shrines and they worshiped Remy eventually the kingdom was remade but the message of Remy was weak and so the Raticate was born the purpose of this group is to spread Remy’s message to as many people as possible.
